admin credential in mongodb 
username= ADMIN
password = ADMIN
link for mongodb = mongodb+srv://ADMIN:ADMIN@cluster0.7wanw.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
however , mongodb has ip whitelist system that i have disabled so you guys can check 

the APIs are created with all the data as params for testing purposes without insomnia. 
of course if this is a real APIs in the real website all that will be in body
for reference i have included commented syntax for if the parameters were not shown in url 

for the token i assume that a simple "role" in body when calling specific API is enough for this test however i can also use JWT .

the Swagger documentation is in .../api-docs

im sorry for no screenshot for docker and kubernetes because apparently they are not connected anymore and docker is not available 
for windows 8 anymore .
